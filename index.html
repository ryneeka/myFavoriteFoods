                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avalanches are unstoppable forces of nature that occur in areas with mountains and snow. Avalanches happen when high snow pack is set off through vibrations, skiers, explosives, steep slopes, winds, unstable snows layers, and warm temperatures. When avalanches are set they become extremely dangerous. Some have even reached speeds of 180mph! The devastation they wreak on the environment is unbelievable, and the damage to life is incalculable. In the last 10 winters, a staggering 284 people have died from avalanches. If all of these people knew about the danger of avalanches many of them would  have not died. Avalanches have also put holes in the wallet of the world. The economic damage avalanche cause per year is $27.8 million,  and the past 30 years it has wreaked over  $800,000,000 on the world economy!

                    <h2><a name="p2">How to spot/ test for avalanches</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are in the back-country you need some experience spotting if an avalanche is going to happen and where your “safe island” is. Your “safe island” is where you would ski to and hide if an avalanche occurs. The safest spots are in the trees and you should ski near to your “safe island” just to have easy access to it because if you are far away from your island and you see or hear and avalanche you might not be able to get to it in time. Even in the trees avalanches can occur; less rare but just as or more deadly than open area avalanches. If you hear the snow have a compressing sound, it means snow layers have collapsed and an avalanche is right around the corner. Also, check the weather before back-countrying. If the weather was sunny before then the sky dumped snow; that is the perfect conditions for an avalanche. To test the area for avalanches, you should bring multiple items to throw at the slope to make a vibration to see if the slope moves or cracks. If it does, go away and do not ski there.</p>

                    <h2><a name="p3">What to do in an avalanche </a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstance that you are caught in an avalanche, there are certain procedure you need to take. If you are unlucky enough to get caught in an avalanche,you have around 10 minutes until the snow in front of your mouth turns into ice and you suffocate. Try to keep calm and breath slowly, it might lengthen your time. If you were not the person caught in the avalanche, you need to act quickly to save your friends life. The best chance of your friend surviving is if his beacon was active. You would use your beacon to find him, but in a huge avalanche it might be hard to friend them even if their beacon is active. I would recommend to take an avalanche class to get some practice with beacon. When you find your friend you will need a probe, a long metal rod, to stab the snow. When you hit something that doesn’t feel like snow you need to whip out your avalanche shovel to dig them out. I would recommend an avalanche shovel over a normal because avalanche shovels are lighter, smaller, and specially designed to dig up people from avalanches. If you do not have an avalanche shovel, you could use your ski. </p>
